inbound.cvec
   - This is the original connection vector file for a 100 Mbps link

inbound-2min.cvec
   - The first 2 minutes of inbound.cvec

inbound-2min-100m.cvec
   - Derived from inbound-5min.cvec, but the sizes of application data units
     are scaled up (1.3883x) so that the average throughput is 100 Mbps

../inbound.cvec
   - Same as inbound-2min-100m.cvec

../inbound-1m-0.30.cvec
../inbound-1m-0.40.cvec

   - Derived from ../inbound.cvec, but the average throughput is decreased,
     and then the sizes of application data units are scaled up / down
